    <h1>OnsenUI & VueJS Side Splitter Example App</h1>
    
    Based off of the OnsenUI Vue `<v-ons-splitter-side>` tutorial: https://onsen.io/v2/api/vue/v-ons-splitter-side.html.

    This example will move the page components into their own `.vue` files.

    This repository demonstrates 3 different methods of implenting the OnsenUI + Vue Side Splitter.

    1. The `using-function-property` branch demonstrates the side splitter by using a function as a property of the `side-splitter-content` component to control the page navigation between the `splitter-side` and `splitter-content` components.

    2. The `vue-router` branch demonstrates the side splitter by using OnsenUI's `vue-router` wrapper to control the page navigation between the `splitter-side` and `splitter-content` components.

    3. The `vuex` branch demonstrates the side splitter by using VueX to manage the state of the side splitter. The state persists from the `splitter-side` component and the tab bar component while displaying the correct content in the `splitter-content` component.
