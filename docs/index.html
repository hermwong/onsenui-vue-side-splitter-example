<h1>OnsenUI and VueJS Side Splitter Example App</h1>

<p>Based off of the OnsenUI Vue `<v-ons-splitter-side>` tutorial: https://onsen.io/v2/api/vue/v-ons-splitter-side.html.

<p>This example will move the page components into their own `.vue` files.

<p>his repository demonstrates 3 different methods of implenting the OnsenUI + Vue Side Splitter.
<ol>
<li>The `using-function-property` branch demonstrates the side splitter by using a function as a property of the `side-splitter-content` component to control the page navigation between the `splitter-side` and `splitter-content` components.</li>
<li>The `vue-router` branch demonstrates the side splitter by using OnsenUI's `vue-router` wrapper to control the page navigation between the `splitter-side` and `splitter-content` components.</li>
<li>The `vuex` branch demonstrates the side splitter by using VueX to manage the state of the side splitter. The state persists from the `splitter-side` component and the tab bar component while displaying the correct content in the `splitter-content` component.</li>
</ol>
